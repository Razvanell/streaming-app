 * * means it can contain 0 or more characters

//Example: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$
//Explanation:
//  ^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+              - On a new line, at least 1 character in [a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]
//  (?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@       - Followed by any character in that range until it meets @
//  (?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.)+            - At least 1 character, followed by a dot "\."
//  [a-zA-Z]{2,7}$                  - A suffix of 2-7 chars at the end of the line
